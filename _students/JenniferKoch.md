**Describe your influences**
I'm influenced by the awkward moment after a racially insensitive question. It's the moment you struggle to tell someone off or laugh it off and crack a joke to show the insensitiveness. I consider myself a happy person who will always answer with humor.

**What does the future of fashion look like?**
I hope that fashion will go back to being a medium to express hopes, fears and opinions with a lightheartedness that moves people to question given circumstances without pressuring or forcing.

**Best moment of the MA?**
The most moving moment is seeing your work as a whole line up and realising what you achieved and how far you have developed in 2 years.

**What's next?**
I need a week to calm and fully realise what happened the last two years. I want to work freelance to continue to express myself whilst having the opportunity to work alongside other creatives.
