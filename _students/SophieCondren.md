**Describe your influences**
Describe your influences.  
I like everything that you're not supposed to
like, finding things that no one wants and then giving them a new life
which they didn't necessarily want, not up cycling though - maybe down
cycling.

**What does the future of fashion look like?**
Hell. Unless you take the aspect of money and commerce etc. away from fashion then the system is never going to drastically change.

**Best moment of the MA?**
Being told that i don't have to do clothes.

**What's next?**
Real Life hopefully.
