**Describe your influences**
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. One body can be many bodies, what
changes is the perspective of the viewer. I want to tell the still untold
story of a womanâ€™s body, and I do this by exploring the malleability of
beauty.

**What does the future of fashion look like?**
It will look like an absurd dream of ourselves.

**Best moment of the MA?**
Tutorials with Tristan Webber

**What's next?**
PROVIDE THE WEARABLE FASHION FROM MY SHOW PIECES AND ANOTHER UNTOLD STORY
OF WOMENS BEAUTY.
