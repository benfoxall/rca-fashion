**Describe your influences**
For my collection, I have been influenced by magic realism a lot. I am intrigued by the question of how people live by a set of rules that have been constructed and restrict what we think we should do and should not, the moments of absurdity that happen in magic realism are very exciting and thought provoking to me, and those moments have influenced my collection a lot.
Artists like Alejandro Jodorowsky and Pina Bausch are very important to me. I see their works as a harmony of the surreal and humour and sadness. My collection ‘COMMASENSE’ is based on this topic and I have tried to create a moment that shares the experience of absurdity in reality.

**What does the future of fashion look like?**
To be very honest, I am not sure. Fashion has been very much about attitude in the past, but now it is more about trend and business. It will become a lifestyle, an outcome of peer and social media influences. I don’t know.

**Best moment of the MA?**
It is difficult to say which one is the best moment because there are so many moments that are so precious to me. The end of first year presentation, maybe. The presentation where we were told to present ourselves instead of fashion clothes and product - I think that is the day that changed my life. Because it allowed me to understand deeply who am I and what I want to do, and to ask the reason why; a moment when I have been encouraged to face my true desire, it gave me guts to overcome all sorts of difficulties in the rest of my life in the creative industry. It made me realise I want to be an artist.

**What's next?**
Continue making and developing my art practice. As I developed a lot of skills in sculpture making and my personal interest in set and installation design. I will be looking for more collaboration, film, sculpture and performance.
