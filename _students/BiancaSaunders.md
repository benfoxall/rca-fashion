**Describe your influences**
Inspired by sculptural work of Thomas J Price juxtaposed to classic renaissance greek sculpture of men.

**What does the future of fashion look like?**
Smaller collections from designers. Consumers looking for more purpose than more clothes.

Being picked to go to Italy for Brioni.

**What's next?**
Travelling then starting my own brand.
