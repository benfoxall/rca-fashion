**Describe your influences**
Personal encoding system that exclusively occurs deep in the senses. And learning varieties of these from others including different kinds of personal senses and thought - reflections and stored knowledge that disturb our understanding, which leads distortion between individuals.

**What does the future of fashion look like?**
A life and harmony - fashion is about a life and communication - varied fashion/individuals are becoming appreciated by different generations. Everyone may own exquisite harmony in their life and fashion, which will enrich our intellect synergistically. Can you explain more what you mean by this?

**Best moment of the MA?**
When I meet lucky failures/happenings. During the process so many creations come not in the form as initially expected and cause disappointment - although such failure often bring another ideas â€“ learning, material and discovery then growth.

**What's next?**
I would like to lean more about different kinds of existence for improving my thoughts and would like to connect people with my creation. My work will be given a life when it is worn, it is not only for viewing - I would like to learn how other people use/wear my pieces/creation.
