**Describe your influences**
Narrative based, from there I feel the colour, the texture, and techniques
and details.

**What does the future of fashion look like?**
More diversity of styles, people can live in different timeline, dress of
the past, dress of the present and dress of the future.  People are bound
together by similar interests and similar ideology.

**Best moment of the MA?**
The journey of exploring yourself, understanding yourself better, and train
yourself to be the person you want to be.  Transform what you envision in
mind to reality.

**What's next?**
I want to gain more experience in the industry, while taking on my projects
on the side.
