**Describe your influences**
I am highly influenced by technology, engineering, Materials, especially challenging material, materials that are out side of the vocabulary of fashion and working on the materials to produce new possibilities.

**What does the future of fashion look like?**
There is no future if everyone is just producing clothes; I mean there’s more than enough of them already. Despite the amount of fashion graduate ever year, the collections from fashion houses and designers every season, are going in a ridiculously high past. Do we really need that?
Future, how far away? In 30 or 50 years later? I feel Biotechnology would overtake, scientist and engineer would become the fashion designers or maybe in reverse.  It would come to a stage where body and garment starts to interact with each other. The garment would be able to adapt to the needs of the body and become self-aware of it surroundings, changing and evolving to suit the need of the wearer.

**Best moment of the MA?**
When the technician says, “I don’t think this is possible, but we can try.”

**What's next?**
I have developed piles of sample and ideas which would allow me to carry on developing for the next ten years and applying those ideas and techniques I have gained in different fields such as product design, architecture, interior and furniture.
