**Describe your influences**
Iâ€™ve always been interested in clothing as a form of identification and the authenticity seen in subcultures and style tribes. I describe my work as Documentary Fashion and for this collection I reflected my experiences of Northern youth culture and took inspiration from nostalgic photographs to explore stages of youth maturity and escapism through the underground rave scene.

**What does the future of fashion look like?**
I would love to see the new generation of designers to develop a means for us to continue our creative output within likeminded collectives. Collaborations and skill exchanges encourage a new form of currency that would remove some financial obstacles that can limit our future.

**Best moment of the MA?**
Receiving the Kaihara denim sponsorship! I received premium Japanese selvedge denim in a variety of weights, ranging from 13.75oz to 23.25oz. Laundering and distressing (bleaching, dyeing, drilling, grating, washing, fraying) played a part in my design process to reflect the processes clothing goes through when worn, particularly at a rave!

**What's next?**
I have plans for knitwear consultancy with Liam Hodges for AW18, and I hope to run a production of the MANCHESTER tees from my collection. I aim to get into the streetwear industry within my interests of graphics, knitwear and denim. I'd love to work for Off-White, Iceberg, KTZ, Palace...
