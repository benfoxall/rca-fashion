**Describe your influences**
I find inspiration in the imperfections and mistakes that are generated from working by hand, using these as the driving force for technical exploration in knitwear.  I enjoy the liberty that working with yarn provides, understanding the material qualities of fibres and how they relate to the function and character of the outcome.

**What does the future of fashion look like?**
Perhaps optimistically, I envisage the future of fashion to be more sustainable and more centered around craftsmanship, with the consumer having more input in the design/making process and a greater understanding and respect for the clothing that they wear.

**Best moment of the MA?**
Making connections with the people I have worked with over my MA is the best experience I can take from the past two years at the RCA.

**What's next?**
Setting up a collaborative design studio, showing in Helsinki Fashion Week, probably more knitting...
