**Describe your influences**
My influences? Mostly frustration. Frustration at the way we are, the way
things are done, seemingly immoveable paradigms that on the face of it seem
insurmountable, but also knowing that there is the ability to knock a chip
out of the granite obelisk that is fashion here and there.

**What does the future of fashion look like?**
You can’t see much when you’re under the water, it’s only when you get out,
and look back that you can really see what’s past. Who knows? I don’t.
Fashion is always quick to adopt an image, slower to adopt any new
mechanism. Maybe this will change.

**Best moment of the MA?**
No ‘moment’, but having the opportunity, every day to work alongside such
strong and devoted people. I’ve learned a lot about myself through the
people I have been surrounded by here, this doesn’t always mean it’s great,
but I love a bit of discourse, so long may those moments continue.

**What's next?**
Power on… Say yes to more creative endeavors, work hard, have a drink,
discover fruit and veg again, have a good wash, Boston sounds good. Wherever
the wind blows, it’s probably not blowing to Paris, not that Paris blows,
it’s just, for me, it’s not all about the clothes.
