**Describe your influences**
My influences come from every day life. Every day experiences. I make things in response to needs I have. The needs I have are created and curated by the people around me. From the beach to bush and back again.

**What does the future of fashion look like?**
I think the future of fashion will alter to include and address a more educated consumer. The mutual respect between the individual and industry will allow for a more sustainable and innovative system that will step away from the circular and repetitive place we are in now.

**Best moment of the MA?**
Living. Eating. Drinking here. Crying and smiling here. I came to do an MA to be better at what I do. I hoped I would make London my home in the process but I didn’t expect to find my family at the Royal.

**What's next?**
I’m looking to be working for someone. Knitwear is a smart way to design. It is a way of making that can minimize waste through fully fashioning and by maximizing stretch generate pieces that can be gender-less and size-less.
