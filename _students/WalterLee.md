**Describe your influences**
Much of what influences me are the colliding moments around me. That collide between realities was the starting point for my work and the disruptions that came from those collisions is what I want to capture.

**Best moment of the MA?**
The internal mock show we had as a whole group. The atmosphere was something I will remember. You had that sense you were a part of something, it was intimate, a privilege and you felt connected.

**What's next?**
My work has a tactile sensibility which focuses on material development and manipulation. My aim was to treat the material in ways that may seem abrasive but controlling it into a refined outcome, which I want to continue in my future practice.
