**Describe your influences**
Wearing a sports tee in a mosh pit…

Influences come from my interests, which are music, Internet culture and gaming. As a result my work is informed and takes form by these references. At times literal, other times abstracted, and many times collided.

My trousers are convertible and transcendent…

This is a result of the democratization of sharing and partaking in music culture, communities and content through Internet, and how that intertwines with our “real life” and experiences.

At the same time, it is about aspiring for something grander, renting a Lamborghini and refilling that fake bottle of Rémy Martin with water…

How deep can a 808 kickdrum go?

**What does the future of fashion look like?**
Models on jet hover-boards geared up in neoprene cowboy boots. Fun!

**Best moment of the MA?**
Best part has been to meet all my friends and brilliant tutors here, friends for life! Our relationships and discussions has been a treasured part for me during the MA.
Other notable moments are Dj:ing in the Artbar and all late nights of hard work and laughter!
