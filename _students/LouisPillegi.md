**Describe your influences**
I am intrigued by objects that serve no purposes besides to exist and potentially decorate a space. I purchase and collect anything that I find humorous or beautiful. The instinct of wanting something then finding a benign purpose for it inspires me. Any artist or designer that explores bad taste influences me. I love BAD things.

**What does the future of fashion look like?**
Im hoping completely tasteless .... but probably more high tech and completely overly functional.

**Best moment of the MA?**
The MA has been a great opportunity to refine the best aspects of my working method. Realising my strengths and strictly focusing on enhancing them. Daily free colour printing as well was exhilarating

**What's next?**
Continue making.
