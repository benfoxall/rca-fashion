**Describe your influences**
I’m fascinated by the idea of dissecting femininity as a construct and separating it from womanhood. I’m inspired alternative ideas of feminine empowerment and films or texts around the subject like the works of Julia Kristeva or Barbara Creed. My work is heavily influenced by the aesthetic of vintage horror films such as Dario Argento’s film.

**What does the future of fashion look like?**
Hopefully slower and more appreciative of the people that work in the industry, from designers to garment technicians. Fashion itself is becoming more fluid but I hope that we will reach a point where we can disconnect ourselves from pre-constructed identities and fully explore what our cultures have to offer.

**Best moment of the MA?**
I actually had a really great time all together. However the first few months on the course when everything felt new and exciting and our sketchbooks were still empty and our desks were clean is a feeling I will always remember.

**What's next?**
I would love to have my own brand, if not straight after graduation, than maybe in a few years time with some more industry experience. I would also love to do some freelance work as a creative consultant or as a visiting lecturer. Ultimately I would like to bridge into filmmaking and photography but that’s a long-term goal.
