**Describe your influences**
Colonialism provides boundless fascination as a concept which ceaselessly works in pursuit of empty dominance. This inspires me to find the commonalities shared through the shapes and patterns within the Eastern world, and trying to find a different vision of visual and cultural harmony, beyond the hyperbolic banality of western appropriation.

**What does the future of fashion look like?**
An inevitable collapse of unsustainable demand for excess will come to a halt within all states of consciousness. Within my lifetime, there will most likely be a revert back to a system where creativity will flourish only within regional restrictions - where value and ingenuity will come back to the hand, resources have to be used from what exists and the cognisant appreciation of the well-made may become a widespread concept again.

**Best moment of the MA?**
The week where I learned of my dissertation result and received a major gift in the form of an external donation to the department. The magpie opportunist and obsessive nerd in me were ecstatic. I was able to pick up and use a lot of materials and wool which I would have never been able to afford in that quantity for collection. It was also nice to know that my studious efforts paid off.

**What's next?**
Post studies at the Royal College of Art, I have an internship with a small hand knit brand based in London, with pattern and sample development. If all goes well, I may be able to become an integral member as a head designer of the brand. Within a longer time, scale, I would like to apply my savvy of hand craft to other firms where such small/medium scale production methods are appreciated.
