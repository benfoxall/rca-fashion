**Describe your influences**
From taking photos of myself wrapped in a tent to making a soft, hanging sculpture that I recorded fellow students moving in. My work is born from the performance of making itself, observing and using the results of these performances to spark design ideas.  

**What does the future of fashion look like?**
I see the future of fashion as a more collaborative process. I think design houses will work increasingly with designers and artists from different disciplines in order to find new, more efficient ways of production and sustainable materials.

**Best moment of the MA?**
Having the opportunity to work in a lively studio alongside talented, enthusiastic designers and specialist technicians. A trip to Pitti Filati in Florence last summer with the other knitwear students was also a particular highlight.

**What's next?**
I want to take my research and knowledge of knit and methods of joining it to woven fabric to a design house or sportswear brand. Another dream is that I will one day start a design agency with my sister, Claire, who is currently studying architecture. A fashion-architecture hybrid agency?!
