**Describe your influences**
Throughout my study, my work has been deeply influenced by philosophy and personal thoughts. Thoughts that have made me reconsider prior assumptions or caused me to revaluate and reflect - words that have provoked my imagination and even forced me to see things from a different perspective.
 “Here, on the edge of what we know, in contact with the ocean of the unknown, shines the mystery and beauty of the world. And it’s breathtaking”
Carlo Rovelli from Seven Brief Lessons on Physics.
This quote has provided the motivating words for my studies and investigations throughout this year at the RCA. It contains the idea that we are always balancing between the known and the unknown – and that the boundary in between keeps moving throughout our life as we continue to learn.
What has become the uniqueness of my work and way of thinking is that it does not suggest something completely new. Instead it examines the fact that there are so many things we know that we have not seen from the right perspective yet.
With my work I wish to ask people to take up a different viewpoint - to reconsider a prior assumption or judgement about what is important and what is not. I believe, that when we choose to take the time, when we choose to be present and conscious we can perceive  things differently and our image of the world will change.

**What does the future of fashion look like?**
That is an impossible question to answer. From my own perspective, I wish there were fewer garments with more considered thoughts behind their conception.

**Best moment of the MA?**
Overall, the time at the RCA has enabled me to get deeper into my own core and values. It has almost been a therapeutic journey getting to know myself and with amazing people around to support and guide.

**What's next?**
A new chapter: Now is time to step into reality. We have been dreaming for at long time and now it is time to find the boundaries and balance in between dream and reality. It is still important for me to keep the dreams and visions close and I will continue with my own work alongside getting experience.
