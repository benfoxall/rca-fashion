**Describe your influences**
WORDS ARE THE SOURCE, THESE BECOME THE VISION OF THE SELF. A SELF THAT
DERIVES FROM EMOTIONS AND EXPERIENCE. WORDS THAT COMPRISE ON THEIR OWN THE
VISUALS OF THE MAN.

**What does the future of fashion look like?**
FANTASISED REALITY. MEN WHO DRESS FOR THEIR OWN VALIDATION AND BREAK THE
BOUNDARIES OF POWER DRESSING. CREATING A NEW MALE RENUNCIATION.

**Best moment of the MA?**
LIFELONG RELATIONS WITH EVERYONE AT THE RCA

**What's next?**
KEEP GOING
