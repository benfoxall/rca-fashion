**Describe your influences**
I used to be a fencer and a dancer, which influenced my perception of interactive performance and functional womenswear. I am also inspired by the relationship between the body and objects. Many conceptual artists, performance artists and contemporary dancer like Stelarc, Oskar Schlemmer and Pina Bausch have informed my work. Besides that virtual reality technology provides me with a more intuitive immersive approach to assist my design.

**What does the future of fashion look like?**
Future fashion will become more diverse, accommodating more forms and possibilities and will integrate more of the latest technology, which change our way of design, sales and display.

**Best moment of the MA?**
Every moment of my MA in RCA was the best and I really enjoy collaborating with people from different fields.

**What's next?**
I would like to pursue collaborations with performance artists, and possibly continue to design more functional accessories within an established company.
