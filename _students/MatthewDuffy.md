**Describe your influences**
My collection is a reaction to growing up in the northern town of Middlesbrough, where I didn’t fit in with the deeply heteronormative culture. In my process I examine the traditional but complex gender performances of my family, including my football-star brother and beauty pageant-winning Indian mother.
The football kit and the pageant sash are both images of my family’s ability to pass and thrive. I used these pieces as the basis of my collection - I recontextualized them into something I understand and take ownership of through drape and knit.

**What does the future of fashion look like?**
I see the future of fashion as one where the power is put back into the clothes - where the clothes are made with craftsmanship, skill and love. I want the industry to create clothes with life, that last for decades, and are loved by the wearer as much or more than the designer. I envision an economy where these clothes are given to and upcycled by charity shops to be loved again by those who can’t afford to buy them new, but have a deep desire to express their identity through beautiful garments.

**Best moment of the MA?**
For me, my best moments were when I worked alongside the technicians to learn and achieved the personal, accomplished garments I envisioned.

**What's next?**
I see myself working within the industry in many ways - as a knitwear designer, a stylist, consultant and more. At the RCA I have realised my strengths, and that my particular set of talents are diverse and unique, so I look to the future as a place where I can fully utilise my skills across the industry.
