**Biography**
With “Journal of Paradox”, Jingwei examines the poetic contradictions of complex life via an exploration of the vulnerable and interdependent relationship between body and clothing.

The collection explores the thematic arc of life's passage from birth to death,
with colors, fabrics, and forms transitioning from skin-tight, nude power mesh suits to voluminous dark velvets in dropped and mutated silhouettes.

Jingwei’s intimate draping technique creates a uniquely symbiotic relationship between textile and flesh, at once enclosing and externalizing the body of the wearer.
His work seeks to establish moments of harmony and unity, in which garment and body become one entity - a living art piece.
