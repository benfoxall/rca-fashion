**Describe your influences**
Go to work in the studio, Come back to house and eat ready-meal pasta.
This pattern as a repetitive frame was expanded towards my own interests in the objectification of every-day use objects.
To me, the conditions of nowadays material reality is about functionalism.
After looking back from my surroundings, I started from the frame of a ready-meal case. This generic frame is specific in its detail through a moulded system and labels. I wanted to show this as ordinary and reject a concentrated aesthetic of beauty. The garments are about Ease-to-use;  they do not need be overly cared for because of it durable qualities. What do you mean?

**What does the future of fashion look like?**
A less trend driven system that promotes individual tastes.

**Best moment of the MA?**
The fruition of my ideas culminates in my work.

**What's next?**
I want to continue the idea of encapsulating an entire package in relation to the garment and it peripherals.
