**Describe your influences**
Viewing the hand and machine as tools which work together. Cordula Kehrer's
Bow Buckets have been a rich resource for me. The combination of
re-purposed industrially made plastic buckets with natural handwoven
raffia, started and continues to be a key reference point in my collection,
for the colours, materials and techniques used. The industrial
polypropylene fibre is key to my collection where I can control and change
the colour, shine and stability through the use of heat and pressure.

**What does the future of fashion look like?**
I hope it slows, with the craft of the garments coming to the forefront and
being celebrated in their own right.

**Best moment of the MA?**
Going to Pitti Filati in Florence during the summer break and meeting
people from around the world

**What's next?**
Who knows .... but first a break in the sun
