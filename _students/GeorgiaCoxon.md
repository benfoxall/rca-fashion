**Describe your influences**
For me, the quality of make begins with the material itself. Leather being
literally a skin gives a material quality unlike any other. The magic of
leather and its potential for patina stems form the fact that every skin is
unique. It is a capricious material whose material metamorphosis always
brings surprises. Therein lies the alchemy – I am never totally in charge
of its transformation and this determines the outcome of each shoe. Through
engaging with the leather and playing with ‘patina’ I have encased hand
painted leathers, moments and memories, in a patent finishes.
I am interested in the subtleties of making where minute collaborations can
shift the classic shapes into a new realm. I aim to make shoes that have
casual elegance- shoes that give the wearer grounding.

**What does the future of fashion look like?**
Taking influence from my background in bespoke shoemaking – observing the
inter- action between customer and maker; there is a focus on quality over
quantity. Within this world there is a deeper engagement with the process
of make, material and longevity. This is at the core of how I produce my
work and I believe we need to make room for it for the future of fashion.
I aim to open up a kind of artisanal engagement with the materiality of our
products. I believe there is more room for products that have longevity. I
want to make shoes that mould to you over time, garments that begin to echo
you, which in turn gives the wearer a comfort, familiarity and individual
connection.

**Best moment of the MA?**
There is not been one best moment of my MA but more a series of moments
through meeting so many exceptional people and building connections that
have formed me into the designer I am now.

**What's next?**
I want to continue working with and experimenting with the potential of
leather…
